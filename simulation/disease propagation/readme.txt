
To run the simulation, navigate to the folder where the function is in matlab and call 'run' from the console window.

The class 'Person' is used to describe the attributes of the members of the population. Most of these are generated by random binomial variables for which the number of trials and proabability of success is known. These variables are used to get time periods based on the probability provided.

A susceptible person's healthStatus attribute is 0, for an infected person it is 1 and it is 2 for immune people. Once the different period lengths are initialized, each time interval, the numbers are decremented by 1 until the are all zero. When the latency period reached zero, the person becomes infectious and when the infectious period reaches zero, they become immune. When the symptom latency period reaches zero, the person becomes symptomatic until that number reaches zero.

First the population is initialized to be a list of Person objects. Next, the input number of people are infected by calling the 'infect' method of some members of the population. These members are not chosen because their position in the array does not represent any type of geographic location and also since people are met at random, it has no effect on the simulation. While the number of people susceptible and the number of people immune does not add up to the entire population, meaning the disease is not yet eradicated, each person is to "meet" a random number of people. If 2 infected people meet, nothing happens. If 2 immune and/or susceptible people meet, nothing happens. If one infectious person meets a susceptible person a random number between 0 and 100 is generated to determine, with the specified probability of infection, whether or not the susceptible person is infected. At each iteration, an image of the population is taken to plot the required line graphs and histogram. Every 500 iterations, a pie chart is drawn to reflect the population at that point.
